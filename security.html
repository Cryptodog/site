            <h1>Security Caveats</h1>
            <p>Cryptodog is experimental software. It is suitable for educational and casual purposes only.</p>

            <p><b>Do not use Cryptodog if you have a critical need for anonymity and privacy.</b> This includes journalists, sources, activists, and citizens of oppressive countries.</p>

            <h3>Technical</h3>

            <p>Cryptodog is based on version 2.2.2 of Cryptocat. The vast majority of changes are UI-related; neither the client cryptography nor server backend have been modified. However, this does not preclude Cryptodog from introducing vulnerabilities not present in Cryptocat.</p>

            <p>For further details regarding Cryptodog's security model, see the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160216105404/https://github.com/cryptocat/cryptocat/wiki">Cryptocat Wiki</a>.</p>
